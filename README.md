# Note:
### This project is still under development so many features are not applied.

# Ecommerce Application (Flipkart Clone):

This project is an ecommerce web application based on the design of official Flipkart Application. It is simply a portfolio project. There are only few products added as of now. More products will be added in future for sure. This project has its own backend server. But I would not like to share the code of backend for now. There is also an admin application for this project, which is controlled only by me, to control the addition/removal/update of product/categories and also order status is controlled by admin

# Features:
1. User can Register/Login.
2. User can pick any order and add the product to cart
3. User can add multiple address and select any one from them for delivery
4. User can check the order status on order details page

3. Run `yarn start` to start the server on your localhost
